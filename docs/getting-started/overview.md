# Overview

Vul detects two types of security issues:

- [Vulnerabilities][vuln]
- [Misconfigurations][misconf]

Vul can scan three different artifacts:

- [Container Images][container]
- [Filesystem][filesystem] and [Rootfs][rootfs]
- [Git Repositories][repo]

Vul can be run in two different modes:

- [Standalone][standalone]
- [Client/Server][client-server]

It is designed to be used in CI. Before pushing to a container registry or deploying your application, you can scan your local container image and other artifacts easily.
See [Integrations][integrations] for details.

## Features

- Comprehensive vulnerability detection
    - [OS packages][os] (Alpine, Red Hat Universal Base Image, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, openSUSE Leap, SUSE Enterprise Linux, Photon OS and Distroless)
    - [**Language-specific packages**][lang] (Bundler, Composer, Pipenv, Poetry, npm, yarn, Cargo, NuGet, Maven, and Go)
- Detect IaC misconfigurations
    - A wide variety of [built-in policies][builtin] are provided **out of the box**:
        - Kubernetes
        - Docker
        - Terraform
        - more coming soon
    - Support custom policies
- Simple
    - Specify only an image name, a directory containing IaC configs, or an artifact name
    - See [Quick Start][quickstart]
- Fast
    - The first scan will finish within 10 seconds (depending on your network). Consequent scans will finish in single seconds.
    - Unlike other scanners that take long to fetch vulnerability information (~10 minutes) on the first run, and encourage you to maintain a durable vulnerability database, Vul is stateless and requires no maintenance or preparation.
- Easy installation
    - `apt-get install`, `yum install` and `brew install` is possible (See [Installation](installation.md))
    - **No pre-requisites** such as installation of DB, libraries, etc.
- High accuracy
    - **Especially Alpine Linux and RHEL/CentOS**
    - Other OSes are also high
- DevSecOps
    - **Suitable for CI** such as Travis CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.
    - See [CI Example][integrations]
- Support multiple formats
    - container image
        - A local image in Docker Engine which is running as a daemon
        - A local image in [Podman][podman] (>=2.0) which is exposing a socket
        - A remote image in Docker Registry such as Docker Hub, ECR, GCR and ACR
        - A tar archive stored in the `docker save` / `podman save` formatted file
        - An image directory compliant with [OCI Image Format][oci]
    - local filesystem and rootfs
    - remote git repository

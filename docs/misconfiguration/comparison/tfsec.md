# vs tfsec
[tfsec][tfsec] uses static analysis of your Terraform templates to spot potential security issues.
Vul uses tfsec internally to scan Terraform HCL files, but Vul doesn't support some features provided by tfsec.
This section describes the differences between Vul and tfsec.

[^1]: Terraform HCL files are not supported.
[^2]: To enrich the results such as ID, Title, Description, Severity, etc.

tfsec is designed for Terraform.
People who use only Terraform should use tfsec.
People who want to scan a wide range of configuration files should use Vul.
